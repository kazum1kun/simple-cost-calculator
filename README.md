# simple-cost-calculator
GUI meter size calculator made per request of my friend

## Introduction
This simple GUI calculator is yet another JavaFX app I built
recently. Currently it supports only calculating task, and more
feature is planned for future updates (actually depends on what
he wants).

## Plans
None at the moment.

## Changelog
### Version 0.0.2 - May 7, 17
**FIX** Output now rounds to 2 digits after decimal point. This
is caused by an unclear specification.

**FIX** Program will now treat empty laceWidth as 1 instead of 0,
 as per request.
### Version 0.0.1 - May 5, 17
**Initial release**
